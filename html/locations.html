			<h2>History</h2>
				<p>Our <i>organization</i> began in 1965 on a farm outside of <b>Harrisburg, PA</b>. <br> It took a lot of work and a lot of people 
				to convince but we did it. We knew that it would help bring the <i>community</i> together and help put an <em>end</em> to <i>animal</i> cruelty. 
				We tried the first few years trying to convince people to stop with <i>animal cruelty</i> but there were some people who did not want 
				to listen. They wanted to <em>hunt</em> <i>animals</i> down rather than keep them as a <i>pet</i>. So, we opened this <i>company</i>
				and changed the world. <br>We saw a need greater than our <i>community</i> and now have locations in <b>PA</b>, <b>VA</b>, and 
				<b>New York</b>.</p>

			<h2>Our Future</h2>
				<p>If you are in the <b>West Coast</b> and have no ability to make it to one of our <i>locations</i>, well worry no more. We are currently 
				working on a plan to get more locations and with your help today, it could be archivable. <br> We have plans on opening locations 
				all over the <b>United States</b> and later Worldwide. We want to spread the word that <i>animals</i> should not suffer the pain.</p>


			<h2>Amenities</h2>
				<p>We aim to help <i>animals</i> feel safe while they visit us. At all locations you can find the following <b>amenities</b>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i>Open Area</i></li>
