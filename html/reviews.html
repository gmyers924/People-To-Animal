			<h1>Reviews</h1>
				<p>We have a lot of people who say <em>good</em> things about our company.</p> <!--I asked people at my co-workers,friends, and family to tell me what they
				think about the site and here is what they thought.-->

			<h2>Respectable</h2>
				<p><q>I think this company is <em>very respectable</em>, keeping the best interest of all pets in mind. Knowing they are in great hands
				after coming from abuse is <em>heartwarming</em>. I <em>love</em> that they are willing to take in several types of <i>animals</i>, nurse them
				back to health and make sure they find a <em>loving</em> home.</q> - <i> Sue </i></p>

			<h2>Impressive</h2>
				<p><q>I got a <em>lovely</em> <i>Rottweiler</i> from this company named <i>Zeus</i>. I <em>love</em> that they take in <i>dogs</i> that may be considered 
				<b>"too aggressive"</b> and give them another chance on life by letting people adopt them out. I was also able to adopt
				a <i>water monitor</i> named <i>King</i> and a <i>parrot</i> named <i>OG</i>. I <em>love</em> my <i>animals</i> and I <em>love</em> this company. </q> - <i> Julius </i></p>

			<h2>Fantastic</h2>
				<p><q>I would <em>recommend</em> this place! We have been searching everywhere for an <i>older dog</i> to keep <em>company</em>. 
				We got the <em>sweetest old lady</em>. She is a <i>9-year-old beagle</i> named <i>Bella!</i></q> - <i> Kirstyn </i></p>

			<h2>Amazing Customer Service</h2>
				<p><q>The customer service was <em>top notch</em>, <em>helpful</em>. The <i>animals</i> were in <em>great care</em>. Sadly, we 
				only had room for one in our family.</q> - <i>Andrew</i></p>

			<h2>Review by the Adams Family</h2>
				<p><q>We found our <em>new</em> family member <i>Pugsly</i>, at <b>People to Animals</b>. He is a <em>nice</em> addition to our 
				family. After some training and TLC from all of us, <i>Pugsly</i> is learning to live with us. This
				<i>organization</i> truly gives the <em>best care</em> and helps these <i>animals</i> to heal before joining a new family.
				We are forever <em>grateful</em>.</q> - <i>Mrs. Adams</i></p>

			<h2>Over The Top</h2>
				<p><q>I give a 5 star; the adoption was quick. They even helped me with my new <i>pet</i>. They answered all my questions and person 
					who was on the other end said that I could call back anytime I needed help with the <i>animal</i>. </q> - <i>Cynthia</i> </p>
