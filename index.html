			<p><strong>People To Animals</strong> is a <em>nonprofit</em> organization where they tend to put an <em>end</em> to <i>animal</i> cruelty and to give the animals 
			another chance at life.</p>
			
			
			<h1>Our Mission</h1>
				<p>You can be effective <em>today</em> by <em>adopting</em> an <i>animal</i>.<br> We aim to rescue <i>animals</i> and have them
				eventually, live with families. We try to find abused <i>animals</i> and give them a better home. 
				<br>A few weeks in our facility, they will go to a <b>foster family</b>. After that we will set the <i>animal</i> for <em>adoption</em> 
				so that it can go to a <em>nice</em> and <em>loving</em> family.</p>

			<h2>Foster Family</h2>
				<p><cite>Pet fostering <b>provides temporary care to shelter animals who need to live in a home environment prior to adoption</b>. 
				While pet fostering is ideal for some people, it is not for everyone.</cite> - petsforpatriots</p>


			<h2>Humane Society</h2>
				<p>We tend to <em>end</em> cruelty to <i>animals</i> and build a better community for <i>animals</i> to live in.
				Also, our belief is that <i>animals</i> are <em>entitled</em> to <em>kind</em> and <em>respectful</em> treatment.</p>


			<h2>Our No Kill Policy</h2>
				<p>We have a <b>no kill policy</b> where <strong>none</strong> of the <i>animals</i> are killed or injured while in our facility. <br>Once an animal is 
				there for a long time, we <em>donate</em> it out for free. When that does not work out, we keep them.</p>
			

			<h2>Animal Abuse</h2>
				<p>If you suspect any <i>animal</i> abuse, you should <em>contact</em> the <b>humane society</b> at <mark>717-555-5555</mark>. You can also try to <b>contact us</b> at 
				<mark>717-932-4242</mark>, and we will put an <em>end</em> to the abuse. <br>Another thing about us is that if we spot anyone abusing an <i>animal</i>, we 
				will <em>notify the authorities</em> who will <em>press charges</em> on the abuser. <strong><i>Animals</i> should not be abused</strong>.
				<br>If you have an <i>animal</i> and it does not behave right or it starts biting people, donâ€™t put it down, we can help it get back to normal with help. </p>
